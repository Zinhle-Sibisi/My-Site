I have built a personal website as per the project requirements from Calliope. The site has a landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page. The main objective of the project was to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and JavaScript. I used a GitHub repository to organize my work, with multiple branches and descriptive commit messages. The website includes a visually appealing landing page with a photo, a mission statement, and a quote, an about page providing detailed insight into my interests and skills, and a portfolio page showcasing my projects. The website has five functional files, namely index.html, about.html, portfolio.html, style.css, and javascript.js, and a descriptive Readme file. Overall, this project helped me hone my web development skills and create a personal site that showcases my abilities, accomplishments, and personality. My folder structure look like the following:

Personal_site
-Index.html
-About.html
-Portfolio.html
-Style.css
-Javascript.js
